# Exercism Python

![Badge en Desarollo](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-%20DEVELOPMENT-green)

In this repository you will find several problemas and solutions from my Python track in Exercism (https://exercism.org)

My public profile: https://exercism.org/profiles/karpo27

Every folder has a:

1- "Instructions" file (.md), wich contains the statements for the exercise.

2- "Solution" file (.py), wich contains one of the possible solutions (yes! there are many ways to solve the exercises)

In order to make the code work Exercism created several tests for each problem. This tests assign values to arguments and expect a value. That is why you'll not see in "Solution" file the call to functions or classes.
