# Instructions

Based on an input file containing which team played against which and what the outcome was, create a file with a table like this:

What do those abbreviations mean?

- MP: Matches Played
- W: Matches Won
- D: Matches Drawn (Tied)
- L: Matches Lost
- P: Points

A win earns a team 3 points. A draw earns 1. A loss earns 0.

The outcome is ordered by points, descending. In case of a tie, teams are ordered alphabetically.

# Input
